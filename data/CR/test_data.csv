"they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides quality music at low prices . ",1
i do give create to creative for their attractive design . ,1
"in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; . only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) . ",0
this model appears to be especially good . ,1
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . ,1
- the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well ,0
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . ,1
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . ,0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 . ,1
"yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable . ",0

"at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! . ",1

"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . ",0
the wizard is particularly sinister . ,0
"my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of `` brick . `` * ",0
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 . ,1
glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality . ,1
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard . ,1
"track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen . ",1
"much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate ",1
"in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . ",0
"exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) . ",1
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well . ,1
"unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually . ",0
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . ,1
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . . ,1
"shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking . ",0
"the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . ",1
"you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . ",1
"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings . ",1
"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . ",1
"i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it . ",1
"now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full . ",0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper . ,1
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal . ,1
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . ,1
"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . ",1
"the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding . ",0
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . ,1
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it . ,1
"to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem . ",0
the remote is a little hard to understand . ,0
. lens cap is a really annoying ,0
"this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . ",1
"if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! . ",0
"however , it has failed to deliver on quality . ",0
it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue . ,1
"nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price ",1
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful . ,1
"however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) . ",0
the height adjustment works well- not perfect . ,1
"i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful . ",0
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . ,1
"to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc . ",0
their site offers no live help at all . ,0
"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture . ",0
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full . ,0
"great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . ",1
"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . ",1
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones . ,0
"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . ",0
"from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price . ",1
"over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! . ",1
"its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! . ",1
"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel ",0
"i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder . ",1
"as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 . ",1
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . ,0
audio is excellent . ,1
"verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game . ",0
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . ,1
"t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . ",1
learning how to use it will not take very long . ,1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router . ,1
"basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help . ",0
"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . ",1
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . ,0
"sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too . ",1
"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! . ",1
"it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . ",0
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it . ,0
"lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . ",1
the movie mode is also working great . ,1
"but with a low price , comes lower quality . ",0
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . ,0
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) ,1
but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design . ,0
"i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen . ",1
"the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) . ",1
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens . ,0
i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views . ,1
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky . ,0
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . ,0
my only significant complaint is sound quality . ,0
"don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space . ",0
"the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . ",1
"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . ",1
"in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution . ",1
the price compared to the ipod is great . ,1
"for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod . ",1
"upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) . ",1
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! . ,1
i am quite happy with the camera . ,1
"the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars . ",0
"they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great . ",1
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites . ,0
the image quality is excellent . ,1
my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything . ,0
the volume level of the phone is not all that good . ,0
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date . ,1
"even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys . ",1
"it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel . ",1
this camera has a major design flaw . ,0
"the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . ",0
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support . ,1
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality . ,0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable . ,0
"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . ",1
"who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . ",0
it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n 't a clue why . ,0
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use . ,0
"the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful . ",0
for the most part this is a good dvd player . ,1
this player seems to work fine with everything else . ,1
"it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s . ",1
"these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted . ",1
"i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , `` i want that one ! . `` i was willing to shell out ",1
i think it 's great . ,1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . ,0
works pretty well . ,1
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $ 35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! . ,0
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download . ,1
the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . ,0
- not compatible with audible . com books . ,0
sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good . ,1
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . ,0
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . ' ,1
"the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users . ",1
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! . ,1
the moveable lcd screen is great . ,1
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches . ,0
"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! . ",1
"right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use . ",1
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important . ,1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use . ,1
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . ,1
"so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work . ",0
this is really a nice diaper pail . ,1
loved the slim design . ,1
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect . ,1
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface . ,1
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . ,0
"touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . ",1
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums . ,1
"it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems . ",1
"styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing . ",0
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . ,1
"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . ",0
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . ,1
the flash is very weak . ,0
"kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . ",0
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus . ,1
"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . ",1
"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . ",0
"if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading ",1
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account . ,1
"it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 % of my calls using it . ",0
it was also the most appealing . ,1
"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! . ",1
"it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! . ",1
"overall , a good buy for the price . ",1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . ,1
"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . ",1
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great . ,1
"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . ",0
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . ,1
only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash . ,0
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate . ,0
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . ,1
"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . ",1
"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . ",1
"remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors . ",1
"for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . ",1
and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) . ,1
"my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above . ",0
the interface took a little getting used to . ,0
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . ,0
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router . ,1
"i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far . ",1
negatives of the player itself : you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player . ,0
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . ,1
"for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it . ",0
"all the `` cool `` features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 . ",1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately . ,1
"this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . ",1
"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the `` year `` field . ",0
i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! . ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it . ,0
"great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) . ",1
it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot . ,1
"nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . ",1
"there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to . ",0
this is a fantastic tool to use . ,1
"along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features . ",1
"when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow . ",0
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from . ,1
"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . ",1
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds . ,0
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have . ,0
"then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely . ",0
"considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . ",1
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router . ,1
"the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod . ",1
"if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 . ",1
but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! . ,1
its not a perfect system but its a very good one . ,1
"this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied . ",1
i like the size and shape . ,1
"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage . ",0
"so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me . ",0
compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) . ,1
"it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . ",1
"the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch . ",1
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle . ,1
"the fact that the `` 0 `` key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the `` # `` key instead . ",0
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling . ,0
"features : click wheel to navigate ; . ability to work with windows or mac ; . optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ; . ability to download pda info ; . automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer . ",1
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . ,1
"the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone . ",0
"in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . ",1
"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . ",0
"all in all , this is a wonderful device . ",1
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute . ,1
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use . ,1
"solid , squeak-free , large screen . ",1
"they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons . ",1
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . ,0
"when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct . ",0
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack . ,0
the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas . ,1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . ,0
"from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . ",1
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files . ,0
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive . ,1
"its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking . ",1
i then realized a major design flaw . ,0
"i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great . ",1
the in ital setup of the router was simple . ,1
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it . ,1
"if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now . ",1
"it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player . ",1
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? . ,0
"the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . ",1
"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . ",0
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space . ,1
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $ 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do . ,1
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy . ,0
it also lets you remove songs from the play order . ,1
"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . ",1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary . ,1
"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . ",0
"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . ",0
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . ,0
wo n 't play a lot of discs . ,0
"i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location . ",0
3 . play java games on it . ,1
i love this pail ! . ,1
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . ,1
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . ,0
i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot . ,1
"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . ",1
"this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work . ",0
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well . ,1
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . ,1
"overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect . ",1
"i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter ! . ",1
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . ,1
"in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . ",1
let the champ win you over ! . ,1
"navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . ",0
its compact and has rounded edges . ,1
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours . ,1
the bass is deep and the treble is clear . ,1
3 ) 4x zoom is nice ,1
"you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so . ",0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . ,1
the volume . ,0
"it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up . ",1
"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . ",1
"it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! . ",1
"there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . ",1
a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . ,1
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds . ,0
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time . ,1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . ,1
"for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that . ",0
the service from the supplier was exceptional . ,1
"when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . ",1
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table . ,0
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . ,1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . ,0
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . ,1
"i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else . ",1
"also , with one click you can help train your spam killer . ",1
the sliding latch is does not stay in place . ,0
it 's also easy to empty out . ,1
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 . ,1
"i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue . ",1
"the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare . ",1
"there 's even an equalizer ( under `` settings `` ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , `` deep `` , and electronic . ",1
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . . ,1
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit ,1
"you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . ",1
"one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like . ",0
"the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color . ",1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . ,1
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers . ,0
it was a symantec error . ,0
": ! . ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool . ",1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . ,0
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . ,0
"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . ",0
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! . ,1
"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc . ",1
"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost . ",0
"i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances . ",1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also . ,1
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . ,0
"00 % good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks . ",0
a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! . ,1
the radio and voice recording are nice . ,1
"when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month . ",0
"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . ",1
apex does n 't answer the phone . ,0
"if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to . ",0
"also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up . ",0
"the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness . ",1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone . ,1
it also works just fine for international calls . ,1
"all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time . ",1
usb 2 . 0 - very fast ,1
"the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera . ",1
"best phone i 've ever owned , period . ",1
"while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with `` alerts `` every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off . ",0
"so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand . ",1
"the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to . ",1
"1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players . ",1
it has great incredibility . ,1
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time . ,0
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . ,1
"with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster . ",1
"for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result . ",1
"it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . ",0
i love the performance and features of this router . ,1
2 ) the champ uses regular store bags . ,1
"if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . ",1
downside : it takes a long time to start up . ,0
"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . ",1
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) ,1
it also has unproven battery life . ,0
feels solid in hand . ,1
"the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . ",0
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 . ,1
best in class . ,1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? . ,0
oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy . ,1
"for more than a year , and it is totally reliable . ",1
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver . ,1
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market . ,1
this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . ,1
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do . ,1
"8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) . ",1
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . ,1
"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have . ",1
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? . ,1
"all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . ",1
it fits in your pocket . ,1
"get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! . ",1
"of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $ 30 per incident . ",0
"recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . ",1
"then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . ",0
i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . ,0
"so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good . ",1
"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . ",1
im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use ) ,1
i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary . ,1
"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . ) ",1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . ,0
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great . ,1
"on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! . ",0
"i forgot , the case does n 't fit . ",0
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function . ,0
took hundreds of pictures and they were great . ,1
6600 looks and feels nice . ,1
"the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one . ",1
"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . ",1
"it wo n 't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store bough ten . ",0
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it . ,0
extremely convenient . ,1
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick . ,1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . ,1
"it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera . ",1
"the karma is only $ 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog . ",0
but not good enough for me . ,0
battery life is ok . ,1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool . ,1
"the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject . ",1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . ,0
"back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run . ",0

getting files onto it is quick and painless . ,1
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble . ,1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it . ,1
mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much . ,0
"it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . ",1
perfect size ! . beats the competition by leaps and bounds . ,1
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . ,0
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags . ,1
"the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot . ",1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies . ,0
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! . ,1
"2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception . ",1
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so . ,0
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software . ,1
"i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this . ",1
the software is great . ,1
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . ,1
"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . ",1
"i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size . ",1
the player is smaller than you think . ,1
overall it is the best camera on the market . ,1
"so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . ",0
"- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't . ",1
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations . ,0

"the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so . ",0
i think this is it 's biggest flaw . ,0
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? . ,0
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers . ,1
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . . ,1
"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while . ",0
3 . it never smelled - at all . ,1
"5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . ",1
"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . ",1
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player ,1
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection . ,1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . ,1
"i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions . ",1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's . ,1
"personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ . ",1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . ,1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . ,1
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface . ,1
im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! . ,1
i absolutely love it . ,1
"first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $ 300 myself . ",0
"but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? . ",0
"well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more . ",1
and we still love it ! . ,1
"if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you . ",1
3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . ,1
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network . ,1
"however , in my mind , $ 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months . ",0
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway . ,0
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software . ,0
the setup and transfer process was cake for me . ,1
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work `` apex `` dvd players and none worked . ,0
"20 gb or 40 gb ? . the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a `` dock station `` and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ) . ",1
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini . ,1
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . ,1
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop . ,1
"but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying . ",1
"however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . ",0
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless . ,0
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too . ,1
5 stars all the way ! . ,1
"i use it on a router table , and it is works well . ",1
overall i like it . ,1
"- bright , visible screen ",1
"i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) . ",1
"otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits . ",0
"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . ",1
"this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope . ",0
"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me . ",1
"- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . ",1
"i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro . ",1
"it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it . ",1
it has a classic design yet looks hip . ,1
"yes , the features are numerous . ",1
"next , the big reason not to buy any norton product : if there 's a problem with it , norton charges $ 30 to even tell them about it . ",0
take quick pictures with excelent resolution ,1
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . ,0
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat . ,1
"freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful . ",1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it . ,0
"it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access . ",1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect . ,1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . ,1
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer . ,1
if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . . ,0
thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products . ,1
"not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . ",1
"this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records . ",1
"first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . ",1
"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . ",1
"service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . ",1
"nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . ",0
"no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus . ",1
"other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . ",1
"anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing . ",1
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up . ,1
"to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted . ",0
"2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon 's . ",1
"ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . ",1
"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . ",1
"i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . ) ",1
great camera . ,1
"apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds . ",1
"i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems . ",1
"still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises . ",0
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright . ,1
"the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with . ",1
i will never use all the `` whistles and bells `` this machine is capable of . ,1
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera . ,0
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into `` what diaper smell `` in less time than that . ,1
i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time . ,0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . ,0
- no proprietary headset jack ,0
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures . ,1
